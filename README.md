# Seesaw Simulator
## Project Purpose
This project provides a simple simulation where users can observe balance by dragging and dropping weights onto a seesaw. This simulation takes into account the physical principles of balance and torque.

## Design Decisions
- The weights were designed in different sizes and colors so the user can visually identify which weight is larger.
- The seesaw plank rotates on its pivot, and the balance changes depending on the position of the weights.
- Drag-and-drop logic and hover effects were added to enhance the user experience.
- Maximum weight limits were applied to both sides, ensuring control of the simulation.
- HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript were used; no libraries or frameworks were used.

## Challenges and Limits Encountered
- Balancing the seesaw and adjusting the horizontal position correctly in the event of a tie was somewhat complex.
- Careful calculations were required to ensure the weights moved on the plank and simultaneously controlled the limits.
- A simple physics simulation was created in the project; real physical laws were not fully implemented.

 ## Using AI
- Provided guidance on AI project logic, drag-and-drop ideas, and some JavaScript calculations.
- Used for consulting purposes for error checking and guidance on terminal/Git commands.
